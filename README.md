MVC course repoo
=====

## About this repo
This repo is my solution to the problems presented in the MVC course from the program "Webbprogrammering" at Blekinge Tekniska HÃ¶gskola. The main idea is to learn about web related object oriented programming using the Model View Controller design. This repo contains the result ive produced while doing the tasks the course required. My Examination project is a short web based game where the goal is to escape capture from an enchanted cave.
